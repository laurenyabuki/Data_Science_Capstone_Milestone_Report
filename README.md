# Data_Science_Capstone_Milestone_Report

The project of Data Science Capstone aims to create your prediction algoithm based on a exploratory data analysis of the Coursera Swiftkey Dataset. The dataset consists of 3 text files containing text for 3 sources (blogs, news and Twitter). The motivation for this project is to: 
1. Demonstrate that you've downloaded the data and have successfully loaded it in.
2. Create a basic report of summary statistics about the data sets.
3. Report any interesting findings that you amassed so far.
4. Get feedback on your plans for creating a prediction algorithm and Shiny app.

The entire project can be accessed in my GitHub repository https://github.com/laurenyabuki/Data_Science_Capstone_Milestone_Report.
